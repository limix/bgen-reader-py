|Bgen| is a file format for storing large genetic datasets.
It supports both unphased genotypes and phased haplotype data with variable
ploidy and number of alleles. It was designed to provide a compact data
representation without sacrificing variant access performance.
This Python package is a wrapper around the |bgen library|,
a low-memory footprint reader that efficiently reads bgen files.
It fully supports the bgen format specifications: 1.2 and 1.3;
as well as their optional compressed formats.

We offer two APIs (interfaces to the library):

    * The :ref:`daskapi` API offers compatibility with
      previous version of this library, a dataframe-based interface,
      and good sustained reading speeds (about 250,000 distributions per second).
    * The :ref:`numpyapi` API offers an array-based interface and faster sustained reading speeds
      (about 4 million distributions per second). Both versions are memory efficient.
