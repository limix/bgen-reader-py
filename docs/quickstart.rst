Quick-Start
***********

We first download the ``example.bgen``, ``haplotypes.bgen``, and ``complex.bgen`` files:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from bgen_reader import example_filepath
    >>>
    >>> filepath = {}
    >>> filepath["example.bgen"] = example_filepath("example.bgen")
    >>> filepath["haplotypes.bgen"] = example_filepath("haplotypes.bgen")
    >>> filepath["complex.bgen"] = example_filepath("complex.bgen")

The above-mentioned files are read by this software in the same way but they present
different levels of genotype complexity.
The variant loci of the genotype stored in ``example.bgen`` have the same ploidy equal
to two and are all unphased.
The ``haplotypes.bgen`` file stores a phased, diploid genotype.
Both genotypes stored in ``example.bgen`` and ``haplotypes.bgen`` have the same number
of alleles for each loci.
The ``complex.bgen`` file, on the other hand, have different ploidy levels and number of
alleles across different variant loci.


Unphased genotype
=================

With unphased genotype we don't have the information about which chromosome holds a
given allele.
Let's read the ``example.bgen`` file and print out some information.

.. doctest::

   >>> from bgen_reader import read_bgen
   >>>
   >>> bgen = read_bgen(filepath["example.bgen"], verbose=False)
   >>>
   >>> # Variants metadata.
   >>> print(bgen["variants"].head())
           id    rsid chrom   pos  nalleles allele_ids  vaddr
   0  SNPID_2  RSID_2    01  2000         2        A,G   6069

   >>> # Samples read from the bgen file.
   >>> print(bgen["samples"].head())

   >>> # There are 199 variants in total.
   >>> print(len(bgen["genotype"]))
   199
   >>> # This library avoid as much as possible accessing the bgen file for performance
   >>> # and memory reasons. The `compute` function actually tells the library to
   >>> # access the file to retrieve some data.
   >>> geno = bgen["genotype"][0].compute()
   >>> print(geno.keys())
   dict_keys(['probs', 'phased', 'ploidy', 'missing'])
   >>> # Let's have a look at the probabilities regarding the first variant.
   >>> print(geno["probs"])
   [[       nan        nan        nan]
    [0.02780236 0.00863674 0.9635609 ]

    [0.00244141 0.98410029 0.0134583 ]]
   >>> # The above matrix is of size samples-by-(combination-of-alleles).
   >>> print(geno["probs"].shape)
   (500, 3)

The columns dimension of the probability matrix of a given variant depend on the
number of alleles, the ploidy, and whether the locus is phased or unphased.
Please, refer to |bgen specification| for a detailed description.

Phased genotype
===============

.. doctest::

   >>> bgen = read_bgen(filepath["haplotypes.bgen"], verbose=False)
   >>>
   >>> print(bgen["variants"].head(4))
        id rsid chrom  pos  nalleles allele_ids  vaddr

    3    sample_3
    Name: id, dtype: object
   >>> # Print the estimated probabilities for the first variant
   >>> # and second individual.
   >>> geno = bgen["genotype"][0].compute()
   >>> print(geno["probs"][1])
   [0. 1. 1. 0.]
   >>> # Is it a phased one?
   >>> print(geno["phased"])
   1
   >>> # How many haplotypes for each sample?
   >>> print(geno["ploidy"])
   [2 2 2 2]
   >>> # And how many alleles?
   >>> variant = bgen["variants"].compute()
   >>> print(variant.loc[0, "nalleles"])
   2
   >>> # Therefore, the first haplotype has probability 100%
   >>> # of having the allele
   >>> alleles = variant.loc[0, "allele_ids"].split(",")
   >>> print(alleles[1])
   G
   >>> # And the second haplotype has probability 100% of having
   >>> # the first allele
   >>> print(alleles[0])
   A

Complex file
============

The bgen file format allows the storage of very heterogeneous genetic data.
In the ``complex.bgen`` file we have variants with different ploidy and number of
alleles, as well as phased\ *ness*.

.. doctest::

   >>> bgen = read_bgen(filepath["complex.bgen"], verbose=False)
   >>>
   >>> # Note how the number of alleles very widely across loci.
   >>> print(bgen["variants"].compute())
         id rsid chrom  pos  nalleles                            allele_ids  vaddr
